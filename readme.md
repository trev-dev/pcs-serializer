# A companion filter for [Pelican Comment System](https://github.com/Scheirle/pelican_comment_system)

[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) is a fantastic Python powered static site generator. It's mature, has many plugins and is pretty fast! Maybe not Hugo fast, but fast enough for a Python enthusiast :)

It's got some cantankerous old bumps though. The class objects generated by Pelican are complex and are not _easily serializable_ for fancy front-end frameworks like _VueJS_ or _React_. The same problem is inherited by Pelican Comment System.

Fear not! I have written a jinja2 filter that will solve this problem for PCS :D

Clone this repository into whatever Pelican plugins directory you're using, add `pcs-serializer` to your list of plugins in your `pelicanconfig.py`, then in your article.html template, use the filter article.comments like so:

```html
<some-vue-component
  comments="{{ article.comments | cserializer | e }}">
</some-vue-component>
```

**Note**: the `e` filter is required after `cserializer` for escaping the resulting JSON made by the filter. Check your component props, you should now have a shiny new JSON string that you can decode into a useful JS object.
